# PYTHON-FILE-AND-EXCEPTION-HANDLING
## Python File Handling and Exception Handling - Exercises

## INTRODUCTION

This repository contains exercises that demonstrate the use of Python's file handling and exception handling features.File handling and exception handling are crucial concepts in Python programming. File handling allows you to perform operations like reading, writing, and manipulating files, which are essential for tasks such as data storage, configuration management, and logging. Exception handling, on the other hand, ensures that your programs can gracefully handle errors and unexpected situations without crashing. Together, these features provide robust tools for building reliable and efficient Python applications.
## CONTENTS

#### Exercise 1: Read and display the contents of a file.
Open a file in read mode and display its contents.

#### Exercise 2: Copy the contents of one file to another.
Copy the contents of one file to another and verify the results by reading the copied file

#### Exercise 3: Count the total number of words in a file.
Read a file, count the number of words, and display the result.

#### Exercise 4: Convert a user-input string to an integer using exception handling.
Prompt the user to input a string and attempt to convert it to an integer. Handle any conversion errors gracefully.

#### Exercise 5: Validate a list of integers and raise an exception for negative numbers.
Accept a list of integers from the user and raise an exception if any negative integers are found.

#### Exercise 6: Compute the average of user-input integers with exception handling and a finally clause.
Calculate the average of a list of integers while managing potential errors. Print a message using the finally clause indicating the end of program execution.

#### Exercise 7: Write a string to a file with exception handling and a success message.
Prompt the user to input a filename and write a string to it. Handle any exceptions and display a success message if no errors occur.

## CONCLUSION
Understanding file handling and exception handling is essential for writing robust Python applications. File handling provides the ability to work with data stored in files, enabling you to perform operations such as reading, writing, and modifying file content. Exception handling ensures your programs can handle errors gracefully, making them more user-friendly and reliable
